          1. A browser consists of 6 main components. The user interface is the end result and what is presented to the person using the website. The rendering engine is what converts teh HTML and CSS to the user interface, it can be thought of as a printer. The browser translates user actions to the rendering engine. The network is what allows people to connect to your website from other locations. Interactive logic and functionality comes as a result of the javascript language. It allows for more flashy features to be added to any website. Lastly there is data storage. This allows the website to remember certain details about the visitor so that it is remembered next time they visit the site. 

          2. The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. The DOM makes it easy to manipulate certain portions of your website. It is useful for stylizing your website. 
          
          3. HTML is your basic language for marking up websites. It is usually combined with CSS to make more stylized websites. XML is a compliment to HTML in that it describes document nodes rather than displaying them. XHTML basically combines to two into one filetype. It also corrects some problems that are present in HTML and brings more support to mobile platforms.
