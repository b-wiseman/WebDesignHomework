            <h2>5. Mtn Dew Voltage</h2>
            <p>Mountain Dew Voltage is a blue raspberry variation of Mountain Dew and is a staple flavor. It tastes pretty good but doesnt stack up against the others on this list.</p>

            <h2>4. Mtn Dew Code Red</h2>
            <p>Code Red is also a staple flavor that has been around as long as Voltage. It is cherry flavored and I owuld best describe it as an extremely sweet Shirley Temple. I loved them growing up but they are much to sweet for me anymore.</p>

            <h2>3. Mtn Dew</h2>
            <p>This is the classic Mountain Dew Flavor. You really cant go wrong with it. You can find it anywhere and if youre curious as to how it tastes, pick one up!</p>

            <h2>2. Mtn Dew Baja Blast</h2>
            <p>This flavor has gotten a ton of attention as of the last few years. It really ran my life in middle school when it was first released in bottles and cans. This was a huge deal for me and my firends at the time as we did not have any access to Taco Bell living in Glendive, MT. Still tastes great today!</p>

            <h2>1. Mtn Dew White Out</h2>
            <p>This is the holy grail of Mountain Dew Flavors. It was widely available when I was a kid and boy I wish I knew what I had. I have yearned for years to be able to taste this just once more. Hopefully Pepsi decidces to rerelease this flavor in the near future!</p>
